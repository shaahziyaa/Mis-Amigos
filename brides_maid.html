            <p> <h1>Bridesmaids</h1> <br>
                Bridesmaids is a 2011 American comedy film directed by Paul Feig, written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, and produced by Judd Apatow, Barry Mendel, and Clayton Townsend. The plot centers on Annie, who suffers a series of misfortunes after being asked to serve as maid of honor for her best friend, Lillian, played by Maya Rudolph. Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, and Wendi McLendon-Covey co-star as Lillian's bridesmaids, with Chris O'Dowd, Rebel Wilson, Matt Lucas, Michael Hitchcock, Jon Hamm, Franklyn Ajaye, and Jill Clayburgh, in her final film appearance, in supporting roles. <br> <br>

Actresses Mumolo and Wiig wrote the screenplay after the latter was cast in Apatow's 2007 comedy film Knocked Up, and budgeted at $32.5 million. Upon its opening release in the United States and Canada on May 13, 2011, Bridesmaids was a critical and commercial success. The film made $26 million in its opening weekend, eventually earning over $306 million worldwide, and surpassed Knocked Up to become the top-grossing Apatow production to date,[7] and served as a touchstone for discussion about women in comedy. <br> <br>

Bridesmaids was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. It received multiple other accolades. In 2012, the film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Melissa McCarthy and Best Original Screenplay for Wiig and Mumolo. This made Bridesmaids the first Apatow-produced film to be nominated for an Academy Award.

            Annie Walker is a single underachieving down-on-one's-luck woman in her mid-thirties living in Milwaukee. Her bakery failed due to the recession, wiping out her savings, and causing her boyfriend to leave her. Having lost her passion, she works a stressful, underpaid job at a jewelry store and shares an apartment with weird British immigrant siblings Gil and Brynn. Annie has a casual sexual relationship with the wealthy and self-absorbed Ted, who treats her like an object. The only positive presence in her life is her lifelong best friend, Lillian. When Lillian becomes engaged to her boyfriend Doug, she asks Annie to be her maid of honor. <br> <br>

            At the engagement party, Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: Lillian's long married and cynical cousin Rita; Lillian's naïve newlywed coworker Becca; Doug's raunchy, foul-mouthed but friendly sister Megan; and the wealthy and snobby Helen, Doug's boss' trophy wife. Annie and Helen are instantly jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian and become increasingly competitive for her attention. However, Helen genuinely puts in the effort to be friends with Annie, despite the latter's hostility towards her. <br> <br>
            
            Annie takes the bridal party to a Brazilian steak restaurant before visiting an upscale bridal shop, where Helen uses her influence to gain entry as Annie failed to make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the entire party – except Helen, who chose not to eat – begins vomiting and experiencing uncontrollable diarrhea from food poisoning, with Lillian voiding her bowels in the middle of the street while wearing a wedding dress. <br> <br>
            
            Annie's suggestion for a bachelorette party at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a Las Vegas trip planned by Helen. Unable to afford a first-class ticket and too proud to allow Helen to pay, Annie books a ticket in economy class. Annie accepts a sedative and liquor from Helen to calm her massive fear of flying and she begins to hallucinate, ending in a paranoid outburst leading to her being apprehended by a U.S. Air Marshal. The plane makes an emergency landing and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides it's best if Helen takes over planning the bridal shower and wedding. <br> <br>
            
            Annie grows close with Nathan Rhodes, an Irish-American Wisconsin State Patrol officer who lets her off without a ticket for broken brake lights. Nathan, who had been a customer at Annie's bakery, repeatedly encourages her to open a new bakery. After a romantic night together, Nathan surprises her with baking supplies, but Annie is annoyed and leaves. <br> <br>
            
            Annie is fired from the jewelry store for having a profanity-laden argument with a teenage customer and is then kicked out by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother. She then travels to Helen's home in Chicago for the extravagant bridal shower, which is Parisian-themed - an idea of Annie's that Helen had previously rejected. After Helen upstages her heartfelt gift by gifting Lillian a trip to Paris, an enraged Annie throws a tantrum and destroys the outside décor; angry that Annie has now ruined every event in her wedding, Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. Driving home, Annie's still-broken taillights result in a car accident, but the other driver flees. Nathan arrives on the scene and admonishes Annie for not fixing her taillights or taking responsibility for her life. Ted arrives to give Annie a ride, causing Nathan to storm off. When Ted suggests Annie perform oral sex on him in the car, she demands he let her get out and she walks home. <br> <br>
            
            Annie becomes reclusive, but Megan arrives and motivates her to take control of her life. Annie resumes baking, gets her car fixed, and tries to make amends with Nathan, who ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep begging for help finding Lillian, who has disappeared. Helen apologizes to Annie, revealing Lillian only hung out with her because she is good at planning weddings, and she does not have any true friends, even her husband does not spend time with her. Enlisting Nathan's help, they find Lillian at her own apartment, having become overwhelmed by Helen's extravagant wedding planning and fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee. Annie reconciles with Lillian and resumes her role as maid of honor. <br> <br>
            
            After the wedding, Annie and Helen finally become friends. Annie also reconciles with Nathan, and they ride away in his police car.
