            <p> <h1> <i> A Thousand Splendid Suns</i></h1> <br>
                A Thousand Splendid Suns is the second novel by Afghan-American author <i>Khaled Husseini,</i>  following his 2003 World Bestseller Kite Runner. The novel was published in English in 2007 (A Thousand Splendid Suns) and was translated into German by Michael Windgassen the same year. <br> <br>
                The novel deals with the fate of two women in Afghanistan, torn apart over the past few decades. One of the women, Mariam, was born out of wedlock. After the suicide of his mother, he married his father Rashid at the age of fifteen. Rashid is in his thirties and works as a shoemaker in Kabul. <br> <br>
                Twenty years later Laila comes into his life. Laila loses her parents in the bombing and marries Rashid as his second wife. In the new family, a close friendship develops between the two heroes under the violent Rashid. <br> <br>
                Husseini noted that he saw the novel as a "mother-daughter story", as opposed to its predecessor, Kite Runner, whom he described as a "father-son story." The novel's film rights were acquired in 2007 by film studio Columbia Pictures.

           <h3> A Thousand Splendid Suns book summary :</h3>
           On the outskirts of Herat, a little girl named Maryam lives with her depressed and fascinated mother Nana. Every Thursday she visits her father Jalil, whose illegitimate daughter she is. Jalil is a wealthy businessman living in Herat with his three wives and nine children. He owns a big house and a movie there. <br> <br>

 Mary was born out of a relationship with Mary's mother, who supported Jalil while Nana was employed as his housekeeper. To cover up the embarrassment of being a bastard, Jalil built a small hut outside the city, where he lived with Mary and Nana and provided little financial support. <br> <br>

On his fifteenth birthday, Jalil promised his daughter to watch his movie to see Pinocchio. She told him about a movie. When he did not show up, Mary ran to his home, where he was denied entry. She feels an impressive moment when her father stands by the window and sees her, and at the same time Porter allows her to deny him. Then he slept in front of the front door on the street. <br> <br>

Returning home the next day, Mary finds that her mother has committed suicide for fear that her daughter has left her. After the death of her mother, Maryam was taken to Jalil's house. His wives begged him to get Mary out of the house quickly. Despite her resistance, she married Rashid, her big shoe in her thirties, and moved with him to faraway Kabul. <br> <br>

In Kabul, Rashid is initially friendly with her and waits for her to reconcile. However, when Mary suffers multiple abortions, she becomes increasingly moody and abusive towards him because she feels unable to conceive a son. One day, Mary's father came to Kabul. He took his car and stood in front of his house and called to go inside. Mary stays in the house and does not open the door for him. <br> <br>

Meanwhile, a young woman named Laila is growing up with her parents in a house next to Kabul. Layla had a close friendship with Tariq since childhood, a boy her age. As they get older it becomes a secret romance. When Afghanistan entered the war and Kabul was hit by increasingly heavy missile attacks, Tariq's family decided to leave the city. <br> <br>

Tariq and Leela's emotional farewell turned into their first love. As Layla's family prepares to leave, a missile destroys their home and kills their parents. Laila is seriously injured and then takes Rashid and Maryam away. <br> <br>

While Laila is recovering from her injury, Rashid shows interest in her and judges her. When a traveler testifies to Layla that Tariq and her family died trying to escape, and she discovers that she was pregnant by Tariq, she agrees to marry Rashid to protect herself and the baby. She gives birth to their daughter Aziza, who is rejected and neglected by Rashid because she is a girl and not the boy she was hoping for. <br> <br>

At first, Miriam is jealous of Laila and Rashid's attention and interest in her. However, their initial coolness towards Layla turned into friendship over time as they together endured Rashid's growing mood and frequent abuse. Friends plan to flee Rashid and leave Kabul. The escape failed and they were caught. Rashid punishes them both by beating them, holding them separately and holding water from them until Aziza is almost dead. <br> <br>

Afghanistan, which feels the ups and downs of the story, feels a new transformation. The Taliban came to power and imposed strict rules on the Afghan people, severely restricting women's rights. Laila, who is again pregnant, gave birth to her second child, her son Zalmai, in an incomplete hospital by caesarean section and without anesthesia. Laila and Maryam fight with Rashid, who strongly supports Jalmai for her upbringing. <br> <br>

 The country is in the grip of a severe drought along with the hardships of life due to the Taliban regime. When Rashid's workshop burned down, he was forced to look for another job. The whole family fell into the grip of growing poverty. Eventually, Rashid sends Aziza to an orphanage so that he no longer has to take care of her. Restricted women's rights prohibit women from walking the streets alone, which is why Laila is often beaten when she wants to go there to see her daughter. Rashid refuses to walk the long way for her. <br> <br>

One day Tariq, who was presumed dead, unexpectedly appeared in front of the house. Laila realizes that Rashid hired a man to tell the fabricated story of Tariq's death. It was a ploy to get Laila to marry Rashid. When Rashid returns home from work, he learns about the visitor from Jalmai and immediately identifies him as Tariq based on his digs. Rashid, who had long suspected Tariq of being Aziza's father and Layla's ex-boyfriend, brutally beat Layla. <br> <br>

The conflict escalates and she tries to suffocate him. Miriam intervenes and kills Rashid with a shovel. He then helps Laila and Tariq to escape. To protect them and give them a chance in the future, he confesses to killing Rashid. He will be publicly executed. Laila fled with Tariq and her children to Muri, a small town in Pakistan, where Tariq has an apartment and a job. <br> <br>

Shortly after the end of the Taliban regime, Laila and Tariq returned to Afghanistan. Representing Maryam, Laila went to Herat in search of her father Jalil. He is already dead, but has left a package for her. Inside is a videotape of Pinocchio, the picture he promised to see with him on his fifteenth birthday. Next to it is a small bag and a letter for him. <br> <br>

Laila reads the letter, where Jalil writes that he has regretted Mary's departure all his life and wishes he had fought for her then. Laila and Tariq returned to Kabul. They used Jalil's money to renovate the orphanage where Aziza lived. Laila now works as a teacher in the orphanage. She became pregnant again and swore that if she became a girl she would name him Mary.

        <h3> <i> <u> Characters</u></i> </h3> <br>
        <b>Mariam</b> an ethnic Tajik born in Herat in 1959. The illegitimate child of Jalil and Nana, his housekeeper, she suffered shame throughout her life due to the circumstances of her birth, and is forced to marry a much older shoemaker and move to Kabul after her mother's death. Hosseini described Mariam as "isolated in every sense of the word. She is a woman who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants a connection with another human being". Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a "friend and a doting alternative mother" to her through the "common hardship" of being married to the "abusive, psychologically imposing" Rasheed.[15] Mariam kills Rasheed while defending Laila, for which she is publicly executed by the Taliban. <br> <br>
        <b>Laila</b> an ethnic Tajik born in Kabul in 1978. The only surviving child of Hakim and Fariba after her older brothers die in the Afghan-Soviet War, she is raised by educated parents who educate her, first at school and later at home when Kabul becomes too dangerous. Compared to Mariam, Hosseini noted she "had a much more fulfilling relationship with her father, her [girlfriends] and her childhood friend, Tariq. She expected to finish school and is looking for personal fulfillment. These are two very different representations of women".[15] Laila's life becomes tied with Mariam's when she is forced to marry Rasheed in order to protect herself and her unborn child after the death of her parents and supposed death of Tariq. This initially causes resentment from Mariam, who "[feels] her territory infringed upon".[15] Despite this, "Laila becomes her daughter for all practical purposes" on account of the struggles and abuse they both experience during their marriage. At the end of the novel, Laila returns to Kabul becomes a schoolteacher at an orphanage. <br> <br>
        <b>Rasheed</b> an ethnic Pashtun from Kabul who works as a shoemaker. Prior to his marriages to Mariam and Laila, he had a son who drowned; it is suggested in the novel that this happened as a result of Rasheed being drunk while caring for him. Rasheed is an aloof father to his 'daughter' Aziza but is notably much more loving towards his son Zalmai. After suffering years of experiencing domestic abuse, Mariam bludgeons Rasheed to death with a shovel while he attempts to strangle Laila to death. Hosseini hoped to make a multi-layered character with Rasheed, noting "Rasheed's the embodiment of the patriarchal, tribal character. In writing him, I didn't want to write him as an irredeemable villain. He is a reprehensible person, but there are moments of humanity, such as his love for his son."[15] Hosseini identified an encounter with an Afghan man who "had a very sweet, subservient wife" and had not yet informed her that he was planning to marry again" as an inspiration for the character. <br> <br>
        <b>Tariq</b> an ethnic Pashtun born in Kabul in 1976 who grew up with Laila. He lost a leg to a landmine at the age of five. They evolve from friends to lovers shortly before he flees Kabul with his family; after a decade of separation, during which time he lives as a refugee in Afghanistan and loses his parents while Laila was led to believe he had died, Tariq and Laila reunite in Kabul. After Rasheed's death they leave for Pakistan and marry, before returning to Kabul, expecting their third child at the end of the novel. <br> <br>
        <b>Nana</b> an ethnic Tajik from a village outside Herat who previously worked as a servant for Jalil. Mariam is born as a result of an affair between the two, and Jalil's favouritism towards his wives and legitimate children leaves her bitter towards Jalil. Nana often reports having the jinn inside her; it is hinted in the book that she in reality experiences from mental health difficulties for which she refuses to be medicated. After Mariam leaves the family home for the first time on her own to find Jalil on her fifteenth birthday, Nana hangs herself after Mariam refuses to stay with her. <br> <br>
        <b>Mullah Faizullah</b> a local Sufi imam who teaches Mariam the Qur'an and supports her and Nana. He dies of natural causes in 1989. <br> <br>
        <b>Jalil</b> a local businessman in Herat who has three wives and nine (later ten) legitimate children in addition to Mariam. While doting on her, his ultimate reluctance to treat her like his legitimate children leads to her breaking off their relationship. Before his death, he expresses regret for his treatment of Mariam through a letter that would have been given to her if she had ever returned to Herat by Mullah Faizullah, instead, it is given to Laila when she goes to visit Mariams home village. <br> <br>
        <b>Hakim</b> Laila's father, a university educated man from Panjshir who works first as a teacher and then at a factory after the war. He is progressive and wishes for Laila to be educated and make her own decisions in life. He is killed in a rocket explosion alongside his wife Fariba while preparing to flee Kabul. <br> <br>
        <b>Fariba</b> Laila's mother, originally from Panjshir. She briefly meets Mariam when she first arrives in Kabul, and is depicted as a cheerful woman. Her disposition is permanently changed after her two sons, Ahmad and Noor, are killed in the Afghan-Soviet War. She spends her time mourning in bed until the Mujahideen are victorious over the Soviets. She is later killed in a rocket explosion alongside her husband Hakim as they prepare to flee the city. <br> <br>
        <b>Aziza</b> the illegitimate daughter of Laila and Tariq, born in 1993 in Kabul. When Laila learns of Tariq's alleged death, she marries Rasheed in order to hide Aziza's illegitimacy. Aziza's birth marks Laila's fall from favour with Rasheed and leads to the friendship between Mariam and Laila. During a famine, Aziza temporary is placed into an orphanage so she can be fed. <br> <br>
        <b>Zalmai</b> the legitimate son of Laila and Rasheed, born in 1997 in Kabul. Laila initially considers aborting him due to him being Rasheed's biological child. Zalmai idolises his father despite his abuse of Laila and Mariam. Zalmai remains unaware that Mariam killed Rasheed and is led to believe he has left Kabul. Zalmai does not respect Tariq, but by the end of the novel appears to be accepting him as a father figure.
