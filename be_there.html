        <p><h1>I'll Be There For you Lyrics</h1> <br>
            So no one told you life was gonna be this way <br>
            Your job's a joke, you're broke <br>
            Your love life's DOA <br>
            It's like you're always stuck in second gear <br>
            When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month <br>
            Or even your year, but <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            (When the rain starts to pour) <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            (Like I've been there before) <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            ('Cause you're there for me too) <br>
            You're still in bed at ten <br>
            And work began at eight <br>
            You've burned your breakfast <br>
            So far, things are going great <br>
            Your mother warned you there'd be days like these <br>
            But she didn't tell you when the world has brought <br>
            You down to your knees that <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            (When the rain starts to pour) <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            (Like I've been there before) <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            ('Cause you're there for me too)
        </p>
