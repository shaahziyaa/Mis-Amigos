            <p> <h1> <i>Swing Time</i></h1> <br>
                Swing Time is a novel by British writer Zadie Smith, released in November 2016.[1] The story takes place in London, New York and West Africa, and focuses on two girls who can tap dance, alluding to Smith's childhood love of tap dancing

           <h3>Swing Time book summary :</h3> <br>
           Unfolding in a nonlinear fashion from the first-person perspective of an unnamed narrator, Swing Time opens in 2005 at a point when the narrator is exiled to a flat in Westminster. It is not clear what circumstances have led her to this situation, but she notes that she has recently been fired. Forced into a communication blackout, the narrator goes for a walk and, on a whim, attends an interview with a film director, during which an excerpt of the 1936 classic Swing Time is aired. Watching the clip, a dance sequence featuring shadows, the narrator has the epiphany that her existence, too, is shadow-like. Back at the flat, she shows the dance sequence to her lover Lamin and notices for the first time that it depicts the actor Fred Astaire in a version of blackface. When she switches on her phone, she receives a threatening message with a video attachment from an old friend. <br> <br>

          
           The narrator first meets her childhood best friend Tracey in 1982, when they are both seven. The only two mixed-race girls in the dance class held in their neighborhood church, the narrator and Tracey are immediately drawn to each other. Tracey’s and the narrator’s parental pairings are mirror opposites: While the narrator’s mother is Jamaican, it is Tracey’s absentee father who is of Afro-Caribbean origin. The narrator’s mother is a politically conscious feminist with a desire to better herself. However, the narrator interprets her mother’s independent pursuits as abandonment. The narrator’s father tries to match up to her mother’s intellectual commitments but often falls short. Tracey is raised by her single white mother, who parents her permissively. The narrator is aware that her own mother looks down upon Tracey’s family. Yet the narrator is captivated by Tracey, whom she considers a gifted dancer. The narrator learns early on that she herself does not have a talent for dance. <br> <br>

           
           Though the narrator’s family seems perfect, the narrator discovers that her father has two other children, who are white, from a previous relationship. Meanwhile, Tracey’s behavior takes a turn for the worse, especially in the presence of adults. At the tenth birthday party of their dance-class peer Lily Bingham, Tracey uses cuss words. Tracey and the narrator also perform and film an obscene dance parodying a video by the pop star Aimee. Tracey steals the video tape of the recording. <br> <br>
           
           In 1998, the twenty-two-year-old narrator is an intern at a music channel called YTV. She encounters Aimee, who is visiting the YTV office to film an award acceptance speech. Something about the narrator’s manner interests Aimee, and she offers her a job as her personal assistant a few days later. The narrator accepts, joining a team that is led by Aimee’s childhood friend Judy Ryan. Though the narrator is charmed by Aimee’s energy, she often finds Aimee’s privileged notions problematic. <br> <br>
           
           When the narrator and Tracey are ten, the narrator learns that Tracey’s father, Louie, has been sent to prison. <br>
           
           In the 2000s, the narrator’s discomfort with Aimee’s ideology becomes more intense when Aimee decides to open a school in an unnamed country in West Africa. Despite her reservation about Aimee’s plan to “reduce” global poverty without the help of governments, the narrator conducts reconnaissance work for Aimee in the West African country. In the village chosen to be the site of the school, the narrator meets the soft-spoken and frugal teacher Lamin. She also strikes up a friendship with Fernando Carrapichano, a Brazilian economist who is the manager for the project. The narrator is discomfited by the disparity between Aimee’s wealth and the poverty around her. Back in London, the narrator’s mother, now a Member of Parliament and in a relationship with a woman named Miriam, echoes the narrator’s misgivings about Aimee’s project.  <br> <br>
           
           When the narrator is fifteen, she purposely fails an entrance examination to a prestigious private school to defy her mother’s high expectations, choosing instead to attend public school. Tracey is accepted at “stage,” or performing arts school, and the friends grow further apart. However, without Tracey, the narrator feels unmoored and experiments with different identities in her new classroom. During her Goth phase, she has sex with an unfamiliar boy at a party. The same night, she witnesses Tracey in the throes of a drug overdose. The narrator’s mother drives Tracey to the hospital. Later, Miss Isabel invites Tracey and the narrator to volunteer at a dance show at their old studio. However, after the show, the ticket money is found to be stolen, and Tracey is accused. Enraged, Tracey and her mother accuse the girls’ old piano teacher, Mr. Booth, of sexually abusing Tracey. <br> <br>
           
           Failing to secure a job after graduating from college, the narrator goes to live with her father, who is now divorced from her mother. Tracey unexpectedly asks the narrator to work as a stagehand for Guys and Dolls, a production in which she is dancing. However, when the narrator quits the production to work with YTV, Tracey sends her a letter revealing that she has seen the narrator’s father having sex with an inflatable doll that caricatures a Black woman. The narrator distances herself from both Tracey and her father. <br> <br>
           
           In her second trip to the village, the narrator grows close to the young teacher Hawa. The narrator suspects Lamin and Hawa may be in love, which they both deny. Many new developments occur over the course of the narrator’s subsequent visits to the village. The school is founded. Aimee’s interest in the school begins to dwindle. Hawa gets engaged to a Tablighi man who follows an austere form of Islam. Aimee begins a relationship with Lamin and plans to get him a visa to New York. Aimee and Judy grow cold towards the narrator, because her mother has been publicly criticizing the government of the African nation in which their school is situated. Lamin comes to New York. Fern confesses his love for the narrator, but she rejects him. The narrator’s discomfort with her current situation becomes more acute. <br> <br>
           
           Back in London, the narrator’s mother tells her Tracey has been sending her vituperative emails blaming her for Tracey’s lot in life. Later, the narrator learns from Miriam that her mother has cancer. She reads the concerning emails and visits Tracey, who has turned into a harried stay-at-home mother with three children. Tracey has also given up her professional dance career. Despite the narrator’s request, Tracey refuses to stop emailing the narrator’s mother. <br> <br>
           Aimee decides to visit the West African country again to open a sexual health clinic at the girls’ school. The narrator and Aimee encounter a gorgeous baby in the village, for whom the narrator feels instant love. The same evening, the narrator and Lamin begin an affair. In New York, the narrator is shocked to discover that the baby they had met has been adopted by Aimee, possibly through illegal channels. <br> <br>

            A month later, Fern informs Aimee of the narrator’s affair with Lamin, and the narrator gets fired and thrown out of her flat. The narrator, enraged and now forced to live with acquaintances in New York, informs the media about the back-channel adoption in which Aimee has indulged. A scandal breaks out, and Aimee arranges for the narrator to be sent to Westminster. <br> <br>

            The narrative of the novel now loops back to the point at which it began. The threatening message with the video attachment is from Tracey. Tracey leaks online the obscene dance video from Lily Bingham’s party. So far considered a whistleblower on the illicit adoption, the narrator is now perceived as manipulative by the public. She secures a British visa for Lamin, but the two drift apart. <br> <br>

            By now the narrator’s critically ill mother is in hospice. During a visit by the narrator, her mother asks her in a fit of delirium to adopt Tracey’s children. As the narrator drives up to Tracey’s flat, her mother dies in the hospice. The narrator watches Tracey dancing with her children in the balcony of her flat.

        <h3> <i> <u> Characters</u></i> </h3> <br>
        <b>  The Narrator</b>
        The novel’s unnamed narrator and protagonist is born to a Jamaican mother and a white, working-class English father. The narrator’s anonymity is a signifier of her self-effacing, mutable nature, which can partly be ascribed to her rebellion against her idealistic mother. The narrator’s mother wants her to make choices that have meaning for Black people as a collective. However, as a child, the narrator simply wants to pursue her love of song and dance. The narrator learns to accept failure early on when she realizes she lacks the talent to be a dancer, unlike her best friend, Tracey, who is a natural. Tracey, also a mixed-race girl, serves as the narrator’s counterpart, representing the path the narrator might have taken under a different set of circumstances. <br>
        
        
        
        
        The narrator undergoes a series of changes as she matures. Her self-effacement makes the narrator join the pop-star Aimee’s employ, subsuming her life in Aimee’s often problematic pursuits. However, when Aimee embarks on her philanthropic endeavor in West Africa, the narrator is pushed into action, noting the injustice around her. She also begins to view Tracey not as a figure predestined for tragedy, but a complete person in herself. Her views on her mother change as well, with the narrator understanding the mother as a complete person, rather than an idealized notion of motherhood. Overall, the narrator represents the pressures a racially divided world exerts on individual identity. <br> <br>
        <b>  Tracey</b>
        Tracey is the narrator’s best friend in childhood. Tracey, who later adopts the stage name of Tracee Le Roy, is the child of a white woman and a Jamaican man. She is essentially raised by a single mother, since her father, Louie, seems to have abandoned the family. A natural and gifted dancer, Tracey develops a troubled personality as she grows up because of the disturbances in her home life. Tracey’s wild behavior seems to grow in proportion to her exposure to the charismatic but violent Louie. At one point, the narrator possibly interrupts Louie sexually abusing Tracey. Tracey often lashes out against the narrator and her parents for their façade of a functional family. After her mother dies, Tracey gives up her dance career and stays at home to take care of her three children. Unlike the narrator, Tracey has been acutely aware of race and class differences since childhood. During the later chronological stages of the narratives, Tracey reveals the vindictive side of her nature,such as when she releases a vulgar preadolescent tape to publicly discredit the narrator. <br> <br>
        <b>Aimee</b>
        Aimee is a pop star of Australian origin whose personal wealth exceeds the per capita income of an African country. Petite, blond, and blue-eyed, Aimee possesses relentless energy and a capacity for reinvention; as a result, her music career spans decades. After the narrator joins Aimee as one of her personal assistants, she learns that Aimee was sexually abused as a child and teenager. Aimee’s resilience in the face of trauma is admirable, yet she is often blithe about the difficulties faced by others. The narrator’s view of Aimee turns more negative after Aimee decides to combat global poverty by inaugurating a school in a village in West Africa. The narrator begins to see that Aimee has a white savior complex, as is evident when she adopts a local baby through questionable channels. Aimee’s ease in switching nations and appropriating cultures illustrate the power of capitalism and white privilege. <br> <br>
        <b>The Narrator’s Mother</b>
        The narrator’s mother, who is also unnamed, is a Jamaican woman. Her mother comes from a large family, and she saw violence and poverty in her childhood. Along with her other siblings, she was brought up partly by her brother Lambert, while their mother worked as a cleaner. Because of her background and her feminist and socialist outlook, she is determined to educate herself. After completing her education, she enters public life and is eventually elected to the British Parliament. Despite her political views, the narrator’s mother is unaware of her own class prejudice, which is evident in her dismissal of Tracey. However, at the end of her life, she admits she could have been more empathetic towards her daughter’s friend. The narrator’s relationship with her mother improves, and the narrator comes to see her mother as a woman trying to find some space for herself in a hostile world. <br> <br>
        <b>The Narrator’s Father</b>
        Also unnamed, the narrator’s father works as an office manager at the start of the novel. He comes from a working-class background, and his own father had a history of crime. He fulfills most of the domestic duties at his home, an unusual role for men of his era. He also has two older, white children from a previous relationship. The father is deeply in love with the narrator’s mother, admiring her intellectualism. After the couple separate, the father assumes work as a postman. The narrator’s relationship with her father worsens after Tracey’s revelation about his personal life. The father and daughter are still estranged when he dies. <br> <br>
       <b> Tracey’s Mother</b>
        A white, working-class single mother, Tracey’s mother also remains unnamed in the novel. She frequently spoils Tracey with gifts and toys and enjoys a warm relationship with her daughter. However, her decision to let Louie back in their life imperils Tracey. Though Tracey’s mother is often judged by others for being a poor parent, the narrator notes that she can be loving and maternal. <br> <br>
        <b>Louie</b>
        Louie is Tracey’s mostly absent father. Violent and manipulative, his worst aspect is his possible sexual abuse of his daughter, Tracey. The narrator discovers that Louie may have another family, which he has kept hidden from Tracey. <br> <br>
        <b> Hawa</b>
        Hawa is a beautiful, young, educated Muslim teacher who lives in the village chief Al Kolo’s compound. Hawa is vivacious and warm and takes pride in her femininity. She often flirts with Lamin and forms a close bond with the narrator. However, Hawa ultimately gets engaged to Bakary, a Tablighi man who follows a strict version of Sunni Islam. As a result, she adopts the hijab and gives up her beloved music and dance. The narrator questions Hawa’s choice, but Hawa asserts her will, suggesting that her choice cannot be understood from a Western lens. <br> <br>
        <b>Lamin</b>
        Lamin is a handsome, soft-spoken teacher of Senegalese origin. The narrator notes that Lamin, like Tracey, is a natural-born dancer. Lamin is politically aware but guarded by nature. Though the narrator suspects he is in love with Hawa, Lamin hides his true feelings. On her visit to the village, Aimee is enraptured by Lamin and ultimately plans to bring him to New York with her. Though Lamin indulges Aimee at first, he reveals to the narrator that he would prefer a younger woman since he wants to have children. Later, Lamin enters a relationship with the narrator, who brings him to London. However, the two drift apart. <br> <br>
        <b>Fernando “Fern” Carrapichano</b>
        A Brazilian economist who is the project manager for Aimee’s school, Fernando or “Fern” is in his forties when he meets the narrator. Sharp and taciturn, Fern is often bewildered by Aimee’s views on poverty and development. Fern is also short with the narrator, whom he often upbraids for her limited notions about life in West Africa. However, he ultimately falls in love with the narrator. After she rebuffs him, he becomes jealous of the narrator’s romance with Lamin and discloses the affair to Aimee, causing the narrator’s dismissal. However, the narrator and Fern become friends again towards the end of the novel. <br> <br>
        <b>Musa</b>
        Hawa’s cousin Musa is a serious young Tablighi man, who advocates a more purist form of Islam. It is Musa who introduces Hawa to her fiancé, Bakary.
