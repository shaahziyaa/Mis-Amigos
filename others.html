    <h1>The Indian Constitution</h1> <br>
    <h3>Essay On Constitution of India</h3><br>
    <p>
        A Constitution is a set of rules and regulations guiding the administration of a country.
        The Constitution is the backbone of every democratic and secular fabric of the nation.
        The Constitution of India is the longest Constitution in the world, which describes the framework for political principles, procedures and powers of the government.
        The Constitution of India was written on 26 November 1949 and came into force on 26 January 1950.
        On 26th January 1950, the Constitution of India came into effect. That’s why 26th January is celebrated as Republic Day in India. 
        
    </p> <br> <br>
    <h3>How Was the Constitution of India Formed?</h3> <br>
    <p>
        The representatives of the Indian people framed the Indian Constitution after a long period of debates and discussions. It is the most detailed Constitution in the world. No other Constitution has gone into such minute details as the Indian Constitution. <br>
        The Constitution of India was framed by a Constituent Assembly which was established in 1946. Dr Rajendra Prasad was elected President of the Constituent Assembly. A Drafting Committee was appointed to draft the Constitution and Dr B.R. Ambedkar was appointed as the Chairman. The making of the Constitution took a total of 166 days, which was spread over a period of 2 years, 11 months and 18 days. Some of the salient features of the British, Irish, Swiss, French, Canadian and American Constitutions were incorporated while designing the Indian Constitution.

    <h3>Features of The Constitution of India</h3> <br>
    <p>
        The Constitution of India begins with a Preamble which contains the basic ideals and principles of the Constitution. It lays down the objectives of the Constitution. <br> <br>
        <h4>The Longest Constitution in the world</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The Indian Constitution is the lengthiest Constitution in the world. It had 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules at the time of commencement. Now it has 448 articles in 25 parts and 12 schedules. There are 104 amendments (took place on 25th January 2020 to extend the reservation of seats for SCs and STs in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies) that have been made in the Indian Constitution so far. <br>

        </p> <br>
        <h4>How Rigid and Flexible is the Indian Constitution?</h4> <br>
        <p>
            One of the unique features of our Constitution is that it is not as rigid as the American Constitution or as flexible as the British Constitution. It means it is partly rigid and partly flexible. Owing to this, it can easily change and grow with the change of times. <br>
        </p> <br>
        <h4>The Preamble</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The Preamble has been added later to the Constitution of India. The original Constitution does not have a preamble. The preamble states that India is a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic. The objectives stated by the Preamble are to secure justice, liberty, and equality for all citizens and promote fraternity to maintain the unity and integrity of the nation. <br>

        </p> <br>
        <h4>Federal System with Unitary Features</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The powers of the government are divided between the central government and the state governments. The Constitution divides the powers of three state organs, i.e., executive, judiciary and legislature. Hence, the Indian Constitution supports a federal system. It includes many unitary features such as a strong central power, emergency provisions, appointment of Governors by the President, etc. <br>

        </p> <br>
        <h4>Fundamental rights and fundamental duties</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The Indian Constitution provides an elaborate list of Fundamental Rights to the citizens of India. The Constitution also provides a list of 11 duties of the citizens, known as the Fundamental Duties. Some of these duties include respect for the national flag and national anthem, integrity and unity of the country and safeguarding of public property. <br>

        </p> <br>
        <h4>Republic</h4> <br>
        <p>
            India is a republic which means that a dictator or monarch does not rule the country. The government is of the people, by the people and for the people. Citizens nominate and elect its head after every five years.
            The Constitution serves as guidelines for every citizen. It helped India to attain the status of a Republic in the world. Once Atal Bihari Vajpayee said that “governments would come and go, political parties would be formed and dissolved, but the country should survive, and democracy should remain there forever”. <br>
