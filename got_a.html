        <p><h1>You've Got A Friend In Me</h1> <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            When the road looks rough ahead <br>
            And you're miles and miles <br>
            From your nice warm bed <br>
            You just remember what your old pal said <br>
            Boy, you've got a friend in me <br>
            Yeah, you've got a friend in me <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            You got troubles, I've got 'em too <br>
            There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you <br>
            We stick together and see it through <br>
            'Cause you've got a friend in me <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            Some other folks might be <br>
            A little bit smarter than I am <br>
            Bigger and stronger too <br>
            Maybe <br>
            But none of them will ever love you <br>
            The way I do <br>
            It's me and you, boy <br>
            And as the years go by <br>
            Our friendship will never die <br>
            You're gonna see it's our destiny <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            You've got a friend in me <br>
            You've got a friend in me
