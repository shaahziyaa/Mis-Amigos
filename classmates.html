            <p> <h1>Classmates</h1> <br> 
                Classmates is a 2006 Indian Malayalam-language coming-of-age romantic comedy-drama film directed by Lal Jose and written by James Albert. The film stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Narain, Jayasurya, Indrajith Sukumaran and Kavya Madhavan with Jagathy Sreekumar, Balachandra Menon and Radhika in supporting roles.[2] Alex Paul composed film's music while Rajeev Ravi handled the cinematography.[3][4] The story revolves around the college graduate class of 1991. In 2006, working in different corners of the world, the friends get together for a class reunion to revive the joy and laughter of their student days. On the night of the reunion, one of the classmates is almost murdered and goes into a coma.[5] <br><br>

The film was released on 25 August 2006 to positive reviews from critics and became the highest-grossing Malayalam film of 2006. It is considered by many critics as one of the best campus based films in Malayalam.[6] The film developed a cult following in the years after its release and is frequently referenced in popular Keralite culture.[7] With the release of film, the concept of alumni meetings started trending in Kerala, and schools and colleges started organising such get togethers to help the ex-students keep in touch with each other.[8] The film is now regarded as a classic in Malayalam cinema.[9][10] <br> <br>

The film went on to win the Kerala State Film Awards for Best Popular Film (Prakash Damodaran and P. K. Muralidharan) and Best Story (James Albert).[11] It was later remade into Tamil as Ninaithale Inikkum starring Prithviraj himself, and in Telugu and Marathi as Classmates (2007) and Classmates (2015), respectively
