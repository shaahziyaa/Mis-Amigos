        <p><h1>Count On ME Lyrics</h1> <br>
            Oh-oh <br>
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea <br>
I'll sail the world to find you <br>
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see <br>
I'll be the light to guide you <br>
We'll find out what we're made of <br>
When we are called to help our friends in need <br>
You can count on me like one, two, three <br>
I'll be there <br>
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two <br>
And you'll be there <br>
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah <br>
If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep <br>
I'll sing a song beside you <br>
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me <br>
Every day I will remind you, oh <br>
We'll find out what we're made of <br>
When we are called to help our friends in need <br>
You can count on me like one, two, three <br>
I'll be there <br>
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two <br>
And you'll be there <br>
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah <br>
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry <br>
I'll never let go, never say goodbye <br>
You know <br>
You can count on me like one, two, three <br>
I'll be there <br>
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four, three, two <br> 
And you'll be there <br>
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
