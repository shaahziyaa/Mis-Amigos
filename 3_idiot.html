            <p> <h1>3 Idiots</h1> <br> 
                Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancchoddas "Rancho" Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan) are three engineering students who share a room in a hostel at the Imperial College of Engineering, one of the best colleges in India. While Farhan and Raju are average students from modest backgrounds, Rancho is from a rich family. Farhan wants to become a wildlife photographer, but has joined engineering college to fulfil his father's wish. Raju on the other hand wants to uplift his family fortunes. Rancho is a wealthy genius who studies for the sheer joy of it. However, Rancho's passion is for knowledge and taking apart and building machines rather than the conventional obsession of the other students with exam ranks. With his different approach Rancho incurs the wrath of dean of college, Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) (Boman Irani). Rancho irritates his lecturers by giving creative and unorthodox answers, and confronts ViruS after fellow student Joy Lobo hangs himself in his dormitory room. Joy had requested an extension on his major project on compassionate grounds—his father had suffered a stroke—but ViruS refused, saying that he himself was completely unmoved by his own son's accidental death after being hit by a train. Rancho denounces the rat race, dog-eat-dog, mindless rote learning mentality of the institution, blaming it for Lobo's death.

                <p><h2>Some Things '3 Idiots' Taught Us About Love, Life & Friendships</h2> <br>
                    <b>1.Don’t follow success, follow excellence; success will follow</b> <br> <br>  Throughout the story, Rancho is telling his friends that don’t chase success. But achieve excellence and success will come to you themselves. <br> <br>
                    <b>2.All is well</b> <br> <br> His well-known phrase, All is well, was a synonym for relaxing in a time of difficulty. He always chants this mantra whenever he is nervous. He also suggests it to his friends to follow it. As it gives an immediate psychological relaxation to his heart and mind to cope with the hard times bravely. <br> <br>
                    <b>3.Learning is everywhere</b> <br> <br>Rancho’s only goal was learning, so he always tried to find learning everywhere. He would recommend to his friends that learning is everywhere. Just focus and the entire world is teaching something. <br> <br>
                    <b>4.Learn concepts and apply them.</b> <br> <br>Racho often tells us that do not learn by rote. Learn by heart and whatever you like will be easy to learn. Apply it to your life and practice it to change your and others’ lives. <br> <br>
                    <b>5.Have some idiot friends around</b> <br> <br>He tells us to have some idiot friends around us. He calls idiots to those people who can think out of the box and can go against the set traditions. If you have such friends who follow their hearts, and ambitions and strive for excellence, you are in excellent company.
                    <br> So, have friends that give you visions and inspire you to follow your dreams. <br> <br>
                    <b>6.Do what you love</b> <br> <br> If you do what you love, you might not earn a lot of money, but you will be happy and satisfied with what you do. If you go for a thing out of compulsion and get a splendid position and money, what to do with that money and position which cannot give you thrill and passion. <br> <br>
                    <b>7.Life is not a race</b> <br> <br> Don’t chase others. Go on your pace. It’s your life. Live it according to your passions and love. We can't live for others, but for ourselves first. If you can’t serve yourself right, how come you serve others well. <br> <br>
                    <b>8. Avoid naysayers</b> <br> <br>Avoid haters, naysayers, and people who say it is impossible. Yes, it is impossible for them because they cannot imagine it and ultimately cannot do it. <br> <br>
                    <b>9.Try it and take the risk</b> <br> <br>Rancho often tells us that take the risk because it gives you an unknown thrill, even if you fail. And there is nothing worse than failure. But failure is nothing if you have the guts to move on. <br>

                    What I Learned from Ranchu is failure is not the real problem but not trying is a significant problem. <br>
                    
                    If you try and fail, at least you will learn something. If you don’t take risks and try, you won’t know you could have done it. <br> <br>
